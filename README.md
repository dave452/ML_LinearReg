# ML_LinearReg
The code below contains the material for the first coding session of ML journal run by David MAson, Natalia Sikora, Luke Golby and Siddharth Pandey.

This session covers the following topics: Linear Regression, an introduction to basic Neural Networks


## Setup Environment 

We will set up the environment using Anaconda. Clone the current repo

```
git clone https://github.com/dave452/ML_LinearReg 
```

Create a new environment with all required packages using environment.yml. (Need to add this file)

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment in conda
```
conda activate ml_tutorial
```
Setup should take no longer than 20 minutes, otherwise you might need to configure the environment.yml with the correct channels for your system. The current environment.yml file is suitable for Windows users.
